# Sun Jitsu - Journal

As numerous studies have shown, monitoring your progress and tracking your habits makes us significantly more prone to 
change our habits and improve faster.  
Small wins are massive motivators but we need to recognize them.      
With this project I create my  first comprehensive web app which provides many utilities
for people who train Martial Arts and similar people willing to progress in sports,  especially in Jiu Jitsu:  
- News, BJJ Tournament Info
- Habit Manager, BJJournal (Training journal), To Do List
## Getting Started
App is developed using Django, Bootstrap.
App will be available on a website soon.
