This app is still (2025) hosted on pythonanywhere and working, however I am not working on it anymore.
It was a great playground, great struggle and a great lesson working on it for over 10 months, however I didn't realize how not scalable and messy using Django (not DRF) + HTMX can be.
I am proud I've made it all myself from scratch, but it's time to move forward. There is a lot of mess in this version, as I didn't have enough experience to plan it properly. 
Creating an app solo taught me Project Management, Problem-Solving, UI/UX Design, Time Management. 
Now using that experience I am remaking it with a better technology stack. [Remake](https://github.com/g4n3sha5/mativated-monorepo).

# About
I created the project inspired by literature about habits and motivation, as Jiu-Jitsu is my passion and I didn't know any app for Jiu Jitsu I decided to create one - to save my Training Sessions, following this idea I did:

- Logo, name, colors and typography

- Landing page and general UI & UX design 

### And a set of small apps serving as tools for Martial Arts students:
#### Clubs
- Add / edit club
- Club Members (others' profiles, and permissions manager for authorized)
- Club Schedule (generator)
- Club Training Sessions (more info in About)
- Clubs List, where all users of MATIVATED can see every Club created, and ask (Request) authorized members of the Club to join it (permissions)

#### BJJorunal (Brazilian Jiu - Jitsu Journal)
- Dashboard (Statistics)
- Add Training Session (Save Session type, length, techniques learned etc.)
- Your Training Sessions (list of every TS, where user can edit or remove every Session)
- Open Techniques base (where every user can add a Jiu Jitsu Technique (name, type etc.) and add Suggestions to other Techniques)
- Simple To Do app where user can add a To Do list, and items to do for each list.

#### Notifications
- Notify authorized members about Requests 

#### Account / Profile
- Manage Account (change password / e-mail) and Profile (personal info (optional) - user's avatar, belt, bio, favourite technique and favourite grappler).

#### additional: About and Privacy policy
As the application processes some personal data, there is information how and what does it do.
